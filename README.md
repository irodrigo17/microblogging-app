microblogging-app
=================

This repository will contain all the code (client(s) and server(s)) for a microblogging app. 
This application is being created for educational/showcase purposes only.

At this moment I have a Rails backend and an iOS client.

There's a matching Pivotal Tracker project [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/724249/stories#), will most likely need to split it in at least two projects, the iOS client and the public API, as I'll most likely need to split this repository :)
